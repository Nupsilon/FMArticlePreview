## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

I learned a lot about positioning (turns out I knew even less than I thought) and element overlap. I also had to research how to create togglable menus, and I have to admit the CSS was more of a challenge than the JavaScript, which was pretty simple. The fact that the desktop share menu was so different than the mobile menu threw me off and I had to readjust a few things.

### Continued development

My code is probably super messy, so I plan to revisit this project in a few months, when I've progressed and my code is cleaner.

### Useful resources

- [Codepen app](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This allowed me to change the color of the Share icon.
- [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) - This is a great tool to design clip path shapes. I used it to make the triangle on the underside of the desktop version of the share menu.
